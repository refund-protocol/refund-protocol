# REFUND — Rug Refund Protocol

REFUND is recovery infrastructure designed to address systemic losses caused by rug pulls and malicious token behavior on Solana.

Losses created by rugs are typically treated as final. REFUND exists to challenge that assumption by treating rugs as recoverable events rather than terminal failures.

REFUND is not charity.  
REFUND is not discretionary.  
REFUND does not rely on offchain trust.

The protocol operates through autonomous classification, adversarial extraction, and deterministic recovery flows enforced by onchain constraints.

## What This Repository Is

This repository contains:
- Protocol documentation
- System architecture explanations
- Research notes and threat modeling
- High-level pseudocode for recovery flows

This repository is intended for **inspection**, not direct execution.

## What This Repository Is Not

- This is not a production trading bot
- This does not expose exploit strategies
- This does not include signal sources
- This is not a guarantee of recovery

Certain implementation details are intentionally abstracted to prevent exploitation.

## Core Principles

- Determinism over discretion  
- Verification over trust  
- Systems over narratives
