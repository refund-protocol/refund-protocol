# Eligibility

Eligibility within REFUND is determined entirely by protocol constraints.

Wallets qualify or do not qualify based on verifiable onchain conditions, not subjective evaluation or discretion.

Eligibility considerations may include:
- Verifiable loss association with a classified rug event
- Onchain transaction evidence prior to liquidity removal
- Absence of malicious participation signals

Eligibility is a protocol outcome, not a moral judgment.

Wallets that do not meet constraints will never qualify, regardless of circumstance.
