# Overview

REFUND is a recovery infrastructure protocol for Solana.

It exists to address a structural failure in the ecosystem: losses caused by rugs and malicious token behavior are treated as final, while the actors responsible rotate freely.

REFUND replaces discretionary responses with deterministic system outcomes.

The protocol does not operate as charity, insurance, or sympathy-based compensation. It operates as an autonomous recovery mechanism constrained by onchain evidence and system rules.
