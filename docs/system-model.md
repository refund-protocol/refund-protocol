# System Model

REFUND operates as an autonomous recovery system composed of three conceptual layers:

1. Detection  
2. Classification  
3. Recovery  

These layers operate continuously and independently of individual user interaction.

The protocol does not intervene manually in cases. Outcomes are produced through predefined constraints enforced at the system level.

REFUND treats rugs as recoverable events, not terminal losses.
